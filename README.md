# python_transcriber

A spanish speech-to-text script using the SpeechRecognition library based in different projects. 

I created it to make my thesis interview's transcriptions less time consuming.

I mainly used this project to create it: https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/using-speech-recognition-to-convert-speech-to-text-python

I did some relevant changes, as the original project could only print the speech-to-text result in the console, and was only available for english speech.
I used some other recomendations to change it to Spanish speech recognition and for it to create and save the final result as a word document.

Will be making changes as I go along.
